            Dixi Yao<br>
            In this project, I implement different machine learning models
            including basic linear models, non-linear models and neural
            networks. During each part, I have some extensions beyond
            the basic conclusion we can derive. After implementing these
            models, I also use some visualization methods to diagnosis the
            models and examine the parameters learned by these models.
            Some small experiments are conducted to verify my guesses
            and conclusions. Besides having a deeper understanding of
            machine learning, I generate some my own understanding and
            conclusions.

            In this project, We find that a networks acts with such process: first
            transforming the human knowledge into machine knowledge
            such as low dimension vectors gradually through convolutional
            blocks or residual blocks, then transforming the machine
            knowledge again into human knowledge such as probabilities.
            The reason behind a good architecture is the network with such
            architecture can successfully transform images into features
            for machine processing and reconstruct human knowledge
            from machine knowledge.

            Fast regulated network over variable sets of features

            Annotation of gene expression images of Drosophila
            embryos is a meaningful and interesting task. However, since
            the complexity and variety of gene expressions, it is also a
            difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a novel model
            architecture combining CNN and RNN models. We use CNN
            model to extract features and use RNN model to learn knowledge
            in sequences. Apart from that, we also propose a novel
            optimization methods including applying different loss functions
            and multiple tempering methods. We then evaluate our method
            on the open dataset FlyExpress, the experiments show our
            model can reach 95.9% AUC, 64.77% macro F1 score and
            65.93% micro F1 score.

            Dixi Yao, Kai Shen, Xiaochong Wei<br>
            Coverage-guided greybox fuzzing is considered the state-of-the-art testing technique in vulnerability detection. As
            for the promising vulnerability detection technique, we address that there are still two challenges to be resolved for
            better performance. On the one hand, code coverage metrics
            should be more informative to distinguish between various
            program executions. On the other hand, seed scoring algorithms should be well-designed for a better balance between
            seed exploration and seed exploitation.
            In this paper, we propose a two-fold hybrid solution to
            tackle these unresolved challenges. We leverage a multi-level
            coverage tree to take advantage of various coverage metrics
            with efficiency. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art reinforcement
            learning algorithms are being leveraged for intelligently scoring the seeds. Evaluations of our work are conducted on a
            lightweight JSON parser benchmark, which is implemented
            for experiments under low computation budgets. More importantly, it reveals the superiority of our approach on the
            basis of unique crashes, unique hangs, and total covered
            paths

            Federated learning emerges as a branch of machine learning for solving problems by multiple clients in a decentralized fashion, 
            where various clients learn the local models on the local datasets, and the master server aggregates the updates from selected clients for global updates. 
            Therefore, efficiently selecting clients for participating in global aggregation is very crucial when considering the trade-off between performance and communication efficiency in federated learning. 
            In this project, we formulate the client selection problem as solving a convex optimization problem to obtain the optimal selection solution. 
            Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our problem convex optimization based client selection method achieves the same performance to FedAvg baseline model while taking significantly reduced time, 
            improving the communication efficiency in federated learning.

            Dixi Yao<br>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/dixiyao/Extended-Structure-Entropy">Source Code</a></b><br>
            IoT security is becoming more and more important
            and we find the problem of device detection attack in IoT
            networks. To solve the anti-device detection problem, we propose
            the concept of safety index. Traditional method based on graph
            isomorphism and graph homomorphism cannot well establish
            the index. As a result, we propose the safety index based on
            structral entropy of a weighted and directed graph where we
            extend the structral entropy to IoT networks. Base on that,
            we propose an efficient deception algorithm. The experiments
            on different networks show the efficiency and outstanding performance
            of our deceptor.

            Dixi Yao,Chumen Liang, Hongkun Hao<br>
            <b>MentoRelate: A Mentor Recommendation System

              Word2Vec<a href="https://github.com/dixiyao/Mentor-Relate"> Source Code</a></b><br>
            Undergraduates have difficulty in searching for
            proper mentors of their own colleges, for existing searching
            engines do not support accurate academic retrieval for professors.
            In this paper, we propose a recommendation model based on
            Non-Generalized Word (NGW) model and Word2Vec embedding.
            We define key words with relatively low affinity with academic
            words as NGWs. By applying an attention mechanism on NGWs
            rather than other key words, our model can better detect mentors
            who focus on subdivision fields indicated by key words, rather
            than recommend mentors based on general and vague subjects
            information. We then develop a recommendation system based
            on proposed model. For evaluation, we conduct experiments to
            validate the effectiveness of our recommendation system based
            on the professor information of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
            Reaching an HR of 82%, our system also performs a fast
            reaction speed. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
            propose the problem and give solution.

            From the benefit, it can meet the needs of a large number of people who need to use solidwork software but do not have enough physical environment.
            Especially for the local environment of our school, all students from engineering platforms, students from the School of Design and
            students in the School of Mechanical and Power Engineering need to use solidwork.<br>
            In terms of cost, not only solidwork software, but with the development of computer and Internet technology, we are teaching and
            in the daily industry, we can also get rid of the situation of installing software on physical machines for students to use. Reduce capital and resource development
            Imagine that it would be very useful to convert a physical machine with application software in the Student Innovation Center into a cloud service with big resource savings.

            Supply chains move products/services from origin to consumer through sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, and distribution. The tracking of goods and services is critical to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, ensure timely delivery, maintain customer satisfaction, improve security, and comply with regulations. By monitoring the movement of products or services, companies can optimize their operations, mitigate potential risks such as theft or fraud, and gain valuable insights into their supply chain.
            <br>
            We propose a solution for tracking goods and services in supply chain system by using V-Guard, which is designed for V2X network and can fit well for supply chain since trucks are main transportation power of the system.
